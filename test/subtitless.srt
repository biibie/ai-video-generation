1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,990
Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,342
science that focuses on creating machines that can mimic human

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:10,486
intelligence and perform complex tasks.

4
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:14,526
AI enables computers to utilize advanced functions such

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,054
as understanding spoken and written language, analyzing data,

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:21,726
making recommendations, and more. One example of how

7
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:25,628
AI is used is in optical character recognition OCR.

8
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:30,168
OCR uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents,

9
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:33,248
turning unstructured content into structured data,

10
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:36,664
and unlocking valuable insights. This is possible

11
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:40,256
because AI can see and understand the text within images and

12
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:44,536
documents, just like humans. This is accomplished with technologies

13
00:00:44,608 --> 00:00:48,736
like convolutional neural networks and recurrent

14
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:52,024
neural networks, which are modeled on the human

15
00:00:52,072 --> 00:00:55,850
brain and nervous system. There are several applications of AI,

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,330
including agriculture, astronomy,

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,810
governance, and many more. In agriculture,

18
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,882
AI helps optimize various farming practices by analyzing data

19
00:01:05,986 --> 00:01:09,066
and forecasting trends. In astronomy,

20
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:12,722
AI enables scientists to analyze significant amounts of data,

21
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,546
helping to discover new scientific insights.

22
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:19,772
AI can also be used for more sinister purposes. AI is

23
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,516
exploited by authoritarian governments to control their citizens through facial

24
00:01:23,548 --> 00:01:26,760
and voice recognition techniques, enabling surveillance.

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,676
This form of AI is also used to classify individuals as

26
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:34,164
potential enemies of the state, targeting them with propaganda

27
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:37,708
and misinformation. Overall, AI is a

28
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:41,396
set of technologies that allow computers to perform a variety of advanced

29
00:01:41,428 --> 00:01:45,308
functions, demonstrating intelligent behavior to maximize the chances

30
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:48,448
of achieving defined goals. Remember,

31
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:52,152
AI is all around us, from the personalized recommendations

32
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:56,500
on Netflix to the interactive conversations with Google Assistant.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,432
Exciting advancements in AI are happening daily and

34
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:02,440
the future of this technology is limitless.
