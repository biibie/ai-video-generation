1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,726
Artificial intelligence is a broad branch of computer

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:07,814
science that focuses on creating machines that can mimic human intelligence

3
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:11,822
and perform complex tasks. AI enables computers

4
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,886
to utilize advanced functions such as understanding spoken and written language,

5
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:19,650
analyzing data, making recommendations, and more.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,806
One example of how AI is used is in optical character

7
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:27,908
recognition. OCR I OCR uses AI

8
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:32,052
to extract text and data from images and documents, turning unstructured

9
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:36,324
content into structured data, and unlocking valuable insights.

10
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:40,092
This is possible because AI can see and understand the text within

11
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:43,812
images and documents, just like humans. This is

12
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:48,236
accomplished with technologies like convolutional neural networks and

13
00:00:48,268 --> 00:00:51,828
recurrent neural networks, which are modeled on the human

14
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:55,466
brain and nervous system. There are several applications of AI,

15
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:59,162
including agriculture, astronomy, governance, and many more.

16
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:03,090
In agriculture, AI helps optimize various farming practices

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,226
by analyzing data and forecasting trends. In astronomy,

18
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:10,426
AI enables scientists to analyze significant amounts of

19
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:13,930
data, helping to discover new scientific insights.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,402
AI can also be used for more sinister purposes.

21
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:21,722
AI is exploited by authoritarian governments to control their citizens

22
00:01:21,826 --> 00:01:26,014
through facial and voice recognition techniques, enabling surveillance.

23
00:01:26,182 --> 00:01:29,406
This form of AI is also used to classify individuals

24
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,286
as potential enemies of the state, targeting them with propaganda and

25
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:36,638
misinformation. Overall, AI is

26
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:40,046
a set of technologies that allow computers to perform a variety of

27
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,654
advanced functions, demonstrating intelligent behavior to

28
00:01:43,702 --> 00:01:46,530
maximize the chances of achieving defined goals.

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,806
Remember, AI is all around us, from the personalized

30
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:54,854
recommendations on Netflix to the interactive conversations with Google

31
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:58,006
Assistant. Exciting advancements in AI are

32
00:01:58,038 --> 00:02:01,150
happening daily and the future of this technology is limitless.
